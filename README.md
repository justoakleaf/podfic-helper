# podfic-helper
Scripts to help podfic makers


## Podfic writer
A utility that templates the podfic posting HTML.

To use: download this repository, and then open the html file `podfic-writer.html` in your browser (tested in Chrome but should work in Firefox). Fill in any details as required and use this when posting. If you want to edit the template, you can do this by looking for the variable s from approx lines 74-122.
